README file for Assignment 1

1. Correctly implemented aspects: I completed all of the required elements, although there is definite room for improve in terms of efficiency and aethestics.

2. Aspects I struggled with:The only coding course I have taken thus far is Comp 11, and that was 2.5 years ago.Getting used to the syntax and resources for github, html, and css was a bit jarring. I moved quite slowly and made many unnecessary errors. I want to improve on consolidating rules and avoiding extraneous repetition. I also could improve syntax for setting up appropriate margins and classes. I forgot to initial the first repository I made and had to delete it to work with the files. I think I fixed these issues but do have some concern that I may have an error again access some of my files because the links on my index page were working and then seemed to inconsistenly stop, although now they seem OK. 

3. Discussed assignment with: Kate Roland and Sam Usher

4. Hours spent on assignment: I spent about 7 hours on this assignment.
